# Create Azure SQL databases

## Overview

 In this exercise, you will start the process by creating a database.

## Create the Azure SQL database

1. Navigate to the **[Azure Portal](https://aka.ms/publicportal)**, and authenticate using your **personal credentials**

1. Select __Create a resource__ \> __Databases__ \> __SQL Database__\> __Create__

    ![Screenshot of SQL Database highlighted in the Azure Marketplace](img/sql-database-marketplace.png)

1. On the **Basics** Tab, in the **Project Details** section, enter your subscription and resource group information

    - Subscription: __Visual Studio Enterprise Subscription__

    - Resource group: __\<alias\>-rg__

		![Screenshot of the Basics tab with the Subscription and Resource group values highlighted in the project details section.](img/sql-project-details.png)


1. Continue in the **Basics** Tab, enter your information under **Database details**

     - Database name: **ContosoAds**

     - Server: Select **Create new**

        ![Screenshot of the database details section of the Basics tab with an arrow pointing to the Create new link under the Server box.](img/sql-server-create-new.png)

    1. In the server configuration blade, specify the following configuration (replace \<alias\> with your own username/alias):  

        - Server name: __\<alias\>-westus-sql__

        - Location: __(US) West US__ *(You may have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the region list to be able to select this region)*

        - Authentication method: _Use Microsoft Entra-only authentication_

        - Set Microsoft Entra admin: Select **Set admin**, and then in the **Microsoft Entra ID** blade, search for and then select **your personal account**

            ![Screenshot of the New server blade filled in with the values specified previously.](img/create-database-server.png)

1. **Close** the **Create SQL Database Server** blade by selecting __OK__

1. In the __Create SQL Database__ blade, specify the following configuration values:

    - Want to use SQL elastic pool?: __No__

    - Workload environment: __Development__

    - Compute + storage: __Select Configure database__

    ![Screenshot of the SQL Database blade with the values filled out as specified previously. An arrow points to the Configure database link in the Compute + storage options.](img/select-configure-database.png)

1. In the **Configure** blade, specify the following options:
    - Service tier: **General Purpose (Most budget friendly)**
    - Compute tier: **Serverless**
    - Max vCores: **2**
    - Min vCores: **0.5 vCores**
    - Auto-pause delay: **Enabled**, **1 Hours**
    - Data max size (GB): **1**

        ![Screenshot of the Configure screen for the SQL Database that is being created. The Looking for basic, standard, premium link/tab has been highlighted](img/configure-sql-database.png)

        > **NOTE:** These options provide the **least possible cost**. To achieve low cost, you are accepting a reduced maximum storage size and reduced overall performance. However, the Max vCores *is above the minimum floor* to which it *could* be set, so that the performance provided isn't too painful.

1. If you haven't already done so, in the **Configure** blade, select **Apply** to return to the **Create SQL Database** blade

1. Continue to the **Networking** tab and specify the following configuration values:

     - Connectivity method: **Public endpoint**
     - Firewall rules - Allow Azure services and resources to access this server: **Yes**
     - Firewall rules - Add current client IP address: **No**
     - Connection policy: **Default**

        ![](img/sql-database-networking-tab.png "Screenshot of the Networking tab of the SQL Database that is being created. The Connectivity method has been set to Public endpoint, and the Allow Azure services and resources to access this server option has been set to Yes. The Next button is highlighted.")

        > **NOTE:** While Contoso is choosing **public endpoint** here for simplicity. A more secure and better choice for real-life work in Azure is to use [Private endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/private-endpoint-overview?view=azuresql).

1. Complete the deployment by selecting __Review + create__ 

    ![](img/review-and-create.png "Screenshot of the Review + Create button in the Azure Portal")

1. Select __Create__ to create your database server and database. Deployment will take between 2-5 minutes, but you can proceed to the next exercise while it is deploying in the background

## Summary

In this exercise, you created a database server in the West US region and a database named ContosoAds on that server.
