# Lab Overview

In this lab, you will begin laying the foundation for IaaS on Azure. You will start by creating a simple virtual network and a default subnet, using the Azure portal. This lab will be the start of deploying a virtual machine to Azure. As you learned in the course theory, the infrastructure as a service concept is used for moving a compute workload to Azure, from an on-premises data center, to realize the benefits of using Azure and cloud computing. You, as the customer, are responsible for managing certain aspects of the infrastructure. This lab, and the follow-up lab on creating a VM, are intended to reinforce the concepts around IaaS.

## Learning Objectives

In this lab, you will learn the foundations of creating virtual networks in Microsoft Azure.

You will:

- Provision a network with a default IP address range and a single default subnet

## Naming Conventions

Throughout the exercises, you will need to define names for different Azure Resources (e.g., Virtual Networks).

To guarantee the uniqueness of those resources please add the first 4 letters of your alias plus the last 2 numbers of your phone number. For example:

* The *special alias* for JohnDoe is John23
* When instructions say to enter __\<alias\>-rg__ you would enter **john23-rg**
